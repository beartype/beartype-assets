This directory provides several versions of **Mr. Nectar Palm** as a horizontal
banner for use across `beartype`_ projects. **Mr. Nectar Palm** is the official
`beartype`_ mascot and original creation of `Felix Hildén`_, Finland's most
significant export since Moonsorrow_ dropped `V: Hävitetty <Hävitetty_>`__ to
acclaim by viking heroes the world over.
